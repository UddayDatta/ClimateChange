# Conclusion

From the animation, it is observed that rainfall has increased a lot from April to July. The high frequency of rain in September can also be noticed. To summarize, we can say that the changing climate and increase in temperature (especially increase in minimum temperature) has a profound impact on increase in rainfall intensity. Due to this sudden increase in rain intensity coupled with rising sea levels, Bangladesh has seen a rise in frequent floods both in internal and coastal parts of the country.
