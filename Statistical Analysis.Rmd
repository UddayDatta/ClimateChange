# Linking rainfall with temperature

From the graphs, it is clearly visible that increased rainfall intensity is directly linked with rising temperature. The change in minimum temperature has a greater impact. 

```{r}
climate_change <- read.csv(file = "Weather Data Bangladesh (1948 - 2013).csv",TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

library(ggiraph)
library(ggiraphExtra)


fit_max=lm(Max.Temp~Rainfall,data=climate_change)
summary(fit_max)

ggPredict(fit_max,se=TRUE,interactive=TRUE)


fit_min=lm(Min.Temp~Rainfall,data=climate_change)

# A Warming, Changing World

Continuing the planet’s long-term warming trend, the year’s globally averaged temperature was 1.84 degrees Fahrenheit (1.02 degrees Celsius) warmer than the baseline 1951-1980 mean.
In Bangladesh, all recent years after 2000 were hotter than average and almost all of them had higher rainfall intensity.
